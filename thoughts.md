1. I feel much more comfortable using the command line, as well as shortcut keys for git, chrome, and rectangle. I've been working pretty hard to not use my mouse anymore!
2. I really enjoy the process of psuedocoding. It's a really interesting process to problem solving and feels like an extremely effective way to critically think in real life AND programming.

1. The biggest strategy I want to focus on is getting extremely comfortable never needing to use a mouse, efficiently move between programs on both monitors, and using Rectangle shortcuts to display everything I need at one time.
2. The second strategy I would love to focus on the most is using psuedocoding for all problems I will face moving forward at Turing.
